<p>With technology, I feel like there needs to be a point where you should stop developing something. We need to know what is too far before we have a product that can change some peoples life. For example, in the book/movie Ready player one, in that the people of that world lives to depend on that game, and people are will to commit suicide if they lose their stuff in that game. So I feel that if we don’t take a step back and ask, “what is too far?” we will never be able to again.

<p>And this is slowly happening with some games, where some players put all their time and money into games. The first notable one was World of Warcraft or WoW. People would spend hours and hours playing this game every day; yes, they found it enjoyable, but what cost? They weren’t going outside and were just staying on their computers playing almost 24/7.
