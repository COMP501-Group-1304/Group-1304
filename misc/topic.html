<h1>Gaming Technology in Academia </h1>
<div id="underline"></div>

<p>
The gaming industry is a fast-growing industry that many would assume to be purely entertainment based. There are a wide variety of genres, from simple puzzle games on mobile like Candy Crush, to expansive, open-world games such as Skyrim, to highly competitive, FPS games like the Call of Duty franchise. With all this variety, one of the resulting outcomes is the development of a range of new technologies designed to keep up with the industry’s expansion. 
<br><br>
An obvious example of this would be the improvement in graphics in games across the board. One of the ways in which graphics have improved is with the introduction of ray tracing. This is a method where an algorithm traces a ray of light and using physics engines can simulate how that ray of light will interact with objects within the world of the game. We can see a comparison of this in the game Minecraft. Below is an image comparing the same scene on the same PC setup, one with ray tracing on, and one with it off.

Changes in game appearance like this is a very visual way of seeing the development of technology in gaming, but there are many behind the scenes technologies which make the game run faster or more efficiently. Physics engines are constantly being improved which help realistic simulations, and there are thousands of research papers published on the topic of improving object simulations and their speeds. For example, the YouTube channel Two Minute Papers puts out content explaining some of the recent developments in the digital simulation space, comparing the new methods to previous ones and highlighting the improvements both in accuracy and rendering time. In one video, Dr Károly Zsolnai-Fehér, the creator of the channel, covered nearly 9 years of progress in cloth simulations (Zsolnai-Fehér, 2021). In the 2012 paper (Yuksal et al., 2012) the time taken to compute the interactions took several hours while similar interactions using the new method from a 2020 paper (Sánchez-Banderas et al., 2020) not only produced more accurate and robust simulations but only took seconds per frame.

<br><br>

There is also new technology around how you experience the game. Examples of this are Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Haptic Gear. The company HaptX have been engineering a new haptic glove which would allow the user to experience physical sensations like weight or temperature in game. VR headsets have really started to become mainstream in 2014 when Facebook bought the Oculus VR company (Barnard, 2019), and a popular use of AR tech in gaming is Pokémon Go, where you could interact with and catch Pokémon in your real surroundings through a digital screen.

<br><br>

All of these technologies either have been, or have great potential to be used in areas other than gaming, especially VR and simulation technology. The uses of these are explained more in depth on the opportunities page.

<h1>Significance in Society </h1>

The speed at which these technologies are being developed, with monumental changes in less than a decade – as seen mentioned previously in the cloth simulation comparison (Zsolnai-Fehér) could be considered somewhat wasted in a hedonistic industry such as gaming. However, considering that this technology can be and is being used in other fields, it presents as an exciting opportunity to impact society in a powerful way.
   
<br><br>

Many of the current and potential uses outlined in the opportunities and choices pages surround topics with great reward to society. For example, in medical settings, the results are massive, both saving lives with more effective surgeon training using VR (The Osso Story, n.d.). Life quality is also greatly increased with haptic tech to replace or rehabilitate those with impaired senses (Shull et al., 2015). Finally, VR tech is helpful for first responders to save lives, whether that be during training or out in the field (Lawrence, 2019).
