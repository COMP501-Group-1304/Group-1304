<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>
The VR/AR niche is growing as every year passes, with the VR industry in particular projected to more than double in the next five years (Alsop, 2021). In the future, there is a genuine possibility of VR/AR being a playable option in the majority of games on the market. Some games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, a viral overworld role-playing game released in 2011. After eight years from release, a VR version of the game was released for the game. Typically games stop getting updates after five years to seven years, but this shows VR has a market in games, and people want it. VR can improve the experience of video games and can improve upon them. 
<br><br>
VR isn’t only for games; you can also use it in offices or the workplace. For example, you can have virtual meetings in VR to see the person’s body language and see the people looking at you. It would be more realistic than if the meetings were in something like Zoom, where you can only see them on a flat screen and hear their voice and maybe their face. 
<br>
VR in the workplace can also be used for training purposes; for example, NASA uses VR to help train their astronauts to make sure they have some “experience in becoming detached from their shuttle and have to use a backpack to navigate their way back or performing complicated tasks in zero gravity”(What Is the Potential of Virtual Reality in the Workplace?, n.d.). 
<br><br>
VR is also not just used by NASA. Aeroplane pilots use flight simulators to practice flying planes since flying a real one for the first would be nerve-racking; that’s why these “games” or simulators are developed. The one pilots have been using is the Microsoft flight simulator series. The series started in 1982 and has had 15 different, with the most recent one being called simply “Flight Simulator”. This flight simulator is the most advanced one yet, with many real-time events like weather, planes, and an accurate world map so you could theoretically fly to your neighbourhood and find your house. In terms of aircraft, you can see real planes flying in the real world inside the game.

Also, according to Statista, healthcare and medical devices will have the most significant expansion in the VR space over the next year, with a 38% probability that it will happen. With the possibility of 5G and VR, you can have a surgeon from America and surgery on a patient in Europe in real-time and with the surgeon being able to see his whole surroundings. A surgery robot that someone in the room controls already exists; it is only a matter of time before they hook up an internet connection with a surgeon in VR on the other side of that connection.
<br><br>
Other technologies that have been developed for VR are full-body tracking, hand tracking and a lot of only technology, with a lot of other technology being developed like smells and running on a treadmill in real life equates to running in the game. More and more different technologies are being made and improved upon, like the haptic suits, which currently only vibrate at a specific part of your body like your upper arm or lower leg. I see in the future that you will be able to feel a tree brush past your arm with it feeling the same in real life. It is not just vibrations going off at different speeds and powers, or you will be about to feel the hand of someone else on your shoulder, or in the sense of gaming, feel the recoil of a gun. With this, soldiers can use haptic suits for military use since soldiers can train with VR and very sensitive haptic suits.
