  Technology in general is famously a double-edged sword in terms of ethics. On the one hand, there have been countless studies showing the impacts of technology addiction. Is it really ethical to be growing the gaming industry as fast as it is? Considering so many people are addicted to video games which leads to diminished social skills and mental health difficulties, along with physical impacts such as eye strains, headaches, and nausea â€“ as was outlined in the risks page of this report.
  <br><br>
  However, we also may have an ethical obligation to keep this rate of growth considering we have also shown the technologies developed have great uses and potential to save thousands of lives and drastically improve the quality of life for thousands more.
  <br><br>
  As it usually surmounts to, I believe the answer is to encourage a balance. Many people also use gaming as an outlet to benefit their mental health, for example those who are perhaps neurodivergent and find it difficult to befriend their peers in person may get that desperately needed social interaction through gaming, and yet people should be encouraged to uphold a healthy balance between their offline and online lives by restricting the time spent on a device to a reasonable limit. 
  <br><br>
  Taking these precautions, we can bypass some of the negative effects which would be considered ethically dubious, and yet still be able to encourage the gaming industry to grow so that the benefits in other industries can still be sustained.
