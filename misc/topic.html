<h1>Gaming Technology in Academia </h1>

  The gaming industry is a fast-growing industry that many would assume to be purely entertainment based. There are a wide variety of genres, from simple puzzle games on mobile like Candy Crush, to expansive, open-world games such as Skyrim, to highly competitive, FPS games like the Call of Duty franchise. With all this variety, one of the resulting outcomes is the development of a range of new technologies invented to keep up with the industryâ€™s expansion. 
<br><br>
  An obvious example of this would be the improvement in graphics in games across the board. One of the ways in which graphics have improved is with the introduction of ray tracing. This is a method where an algorithm traces a ray of light and using physics engines can simulate how that ray of light will interact with objects within the world of the game. We can see a comparison of this in the game Minecraft. Below is an image comparing the same scene on the same PC setup, one with ray tracing on, and one with it off.

This is a test.
