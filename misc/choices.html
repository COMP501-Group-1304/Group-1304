<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<div id="underline"></div>

<p><i>by Nathan Flanagan</i><p><br><br>
	
<p>There are quite a few choices when it comes to the direction VR can go with its technology, the type of fields it’s used in, for creative uses or simulation for practice. VR is quite fluid in what it can be used for compared to its older counterparts such as computers. The biggest factor is immersion into the technology, feeling part of the given world/ simulation. VR is an expensive technology to invest in, and in recent years developers are moving from making VR games, to creating education simulations. 
<br><br>
The pros and cons of VR are few and many, respectively. Some pros being the positive experiences users feel when using and testing out games and simulations, while cons can be the high prices investing in VR and making new products. With cons like these it's hard to justify making VR just for games, and consequently companies are expanding the uses of this developing technology. For example, in a video by CNBC companies are investing in creating virtual simulations of dangerous simulations, some being chemical leakage and how a firefighter will respond to this disaster - this normally being very dangerous and expensive to re-enact. 
<br><br>
Other companies are creating simulations of real-world dangers in the workforce, to train new trainees the dangers of high building loose scaffolding, and dangers to look out for (CNBC, 2019). In the video it is stated that $150 billion is lost every year due to workplace deaths. This, while being large in number, isn’t as large as the cost of VR simulations, thus these companies are investing to prevent these deaths and train new workforce members for dangerous jobs. 
<br><br>
In addition, CNBC also goes on to say that training in VR is more effective than sitting in a seminar watching a PowerPoint presentation. Humans retain more information when interacting in a 3D environment, and those who train using VR simulations have shown a 30% increase in knowledge retention two weeks after the training compared to traditional training methods.
<br><br>
Using VR for these fields is helpful in helping society in not only education for teaching, but saving lives while also preventing the learners from facing dangers. This will prepare them for real life scenarios for firefighters to correctly make sound judgement and for builders to be more aware of their surroundings, and react faster to danger, or helping someone in danger. 
<br><br>
VR can be used for more than just simulations though. It has many uses, some for creativity in video games, others in architecture. Using VR for architectural purposes, for example, designing buildings in simulated worlds using world engines, replicating real worlds to see how the buildings go against nature and physics is good usage of the technology. Using VR for architecture landscapes to explore different uses of buildings in landforms and to share ideas is great for future development of buildings and safety measures put in place from these designs in the virtual world (ScienceDirect, 2015). This means through the use of VR, creating better designed buildings safety wise is easier, due to using physics engines inside virtual reality simulations, another choice with the use of VR. 
<br><br>
One place VR can help in today and future is for therapy purposes, mainly psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is the act of using psychology to help with mental and emotional problems in a person. VR is a good tool for use in therapy, as it can create fake scenarios for a person to interact with, and deal with emotional and mental problems they face. The use of VR has been tested and has positive uses for treating health disorders (Botella C, Serrano B, Baños RM, Garcia-Palacios A, 2015). The use of VR can change a person's behaviour using these simulated worlds, in a safe environment set by the therapist. This technology is very helpful as it creates opportunities for the people to get good and safe help from this technology to treat their disorders, be it anxiety or trauma.
<br><br>
VR has many choices for its use in the modern technologically advancing world. It can be used for gaming, or for simulations for preventing disaster and training and educating people, and it can also be used to save people from danger, or help with mental and emotional help. This technology has many uses and can be used in great versatility.
