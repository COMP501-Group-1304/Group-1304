One major ethical problem of gaming technology such as VR is isolation. When VR becomes the biggest norm in technology in the future, a problem that people will face is isolation from other people due to being enclosed in a virtual world. This will lead to many problems such as mental and emotional health issues due to long periods of not interacting with people face to face.
<br><br>
From what Iâ€™ve researched about the topic, there are many ways VR is being implemented, video games, safety simulations, architecture and design and even psychotherapy. Tackling the problem of isolation may become a problem, if gamers are immersed in their world too deeply they could be disconnected from society and will find it hard interacting with people again. Some workaholics like architects who work continuous hours on VR making their perfect designs will also be void of interaction, and also face many challenges in interacting after not using VR. While this technology is ground-breaking and has many positive uses, the ethical problems it comes with need to be resolved before it launches in usage.
<br><br>
My recommendation is to either focus this technology for career simulation for safety and design, or have operational breaks in the software, forcing the user to not proceed longer than say 4 hours of usage. This should help people who use VR stay connected to reality, but also have time to do what they need with the given technology.
