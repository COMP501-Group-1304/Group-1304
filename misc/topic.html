<h1>Gaming Technology in Academia </h1>

  The gaming industry is a fast-growing industry that many would assume to be purely entertainment based. There are a wide variety of genres, from simple puzzle games on mobile like Candy Crush, to expansive, open-world games such as Skyrim, to highly competitive, FPS games like the Call of Duty franchise. With all this variety, one of the resulting outcomes is the development of a range of new technologies invented to keep up with the industryâ€™s expansion. 
<br><br>
  An obvious example of this would be the improvement in graphics in games across the board. One of the ways in which graphics have improved is with the introduction of ray tracing. This is a method where an algorithm traces a ray of light and using physics engines can simulate how that ray of light will interact with objects within the world of the game. We can see a comparison of this in the game Minecraft. Below is an image comparing the same scene on the same PC setup, one with ray tracing on, and one with it off.

  <p>Where does it come from?
  
  Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it 
  over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
   consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
   Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 
   45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor 
   sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br><br>
  
  The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus 
  Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
   Rackham.<br><br>
